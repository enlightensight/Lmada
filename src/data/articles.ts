Stable, high-producing mammalian cell lines are the foundation of every successful biologics program. The choices made during cell line development echo through process development, analytical characterization, and GMP manufacturing for years.

### From Vector Design to Clone Selection
Our platform begins with codon optimization and expression vector design tailored to the molecule format — IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, bispecifics, or fusion proteins. Following transfection of CHO host cells, stable pools are generated and single-cell cloning is performed under documented, regulatory-ready conditions.

> "A well-characterized clone selected early prevents months of rework during scale-up and tech transfer."

### High-Throughput Clone Screening
Automated screening arrays evaluate hundreds of clones for productivity, growth profile, and product quality attributes in parallel. Candidates are ranked not only on titer but also on aggregation, charge variants, and glycosylation — so the lead clone is manufacturable, not just productive.

The result: a fully characterized Research Cell Bank with the documentation regulators expect, delivered on a compressed timeline.

Timeline pressure defines early biologics development. Our gene-to-RCB pathway delivers a fully documented Research Cell Bank in approximately 16 weeks from DNA sequence receipt.

### The Compressed Pathway
The schedule integrates vector construction, transfection, stable pool generation, single-cell cloning, and clone screening into parallel workstreams rather than sequential ones. Early product quality screening runs alongside productivity assessment so weak candidates are eliminated before they consume calendar time.

#### What the 16-Week Package Includes:
1. **Sequence and vector documentation** suitable for regulatory filings.
2. **Clonality evidence** and genetic stability data for the selected clone.
3. **RCB generation** with sterility, mycoplasma, and identity testing.

For sponsors, this means earlier entry into process development and a cleaner handoff to GMP manufacturing.

Upstream process development is where productivity is won or lost. A robust fed-batch or perfusion process balances titer, cell health, and product quality attributes — all within a design space that survives scale-up.

### Scale-Down Models That Predict Scale-Up
We develop processes in qualified scale-down bioreactor systems that mirror the mass transfer and mixing behavior of pilot and GMP vessels. This allows meaningful DOE studies on feed composition, feeding schedules, temperature shifts, and pH setpoints before committing manufacturing capacity.

### Perfusion and Intensified Processing
For molecules that benefit from intensified operation, we evaluate perfusion configurations with cell retention devices, mapping bleed rates and media exchange against viability and product quality. The outcome is a control strategy documented for technology transfer — not a process that only works in one lab.

Downstream purification transforms harvested cell culture fluid into a drug substance that meets stringent purity specifications. Every unit operation must clear its impurity target while protecting yield.

### Building the Chromatography Train
A typical platform sequence pairs Protein A capture with one or two polishing steps — ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, or mixed-mode chromatography — selected from molecule-specific screening. We optimize load conditions, wash strategies, and elution gradients to control aggregates, host cell proteins, and leached Protein A.

### Viral Clearance by Design
Viral inactivation and nanofiltration steps are placed deliberately within the sequence and validated to demonstrate robust log-reduction values. Combined with orthogonal analytical testing at every stage, the result is a purification process that is both efficient and inspection-ready.

Monoclonal antibodies are structurally complex, and each analytical technique sees only part of the molecule. Orthogonal characterization — measuring the same attribute by independent methods — is what turns data into confidence.

### The Core Attribute Panel
Our characterization programs combine size exclusion chromatography for aggregation, CE-SDS and capillary isoelectric focusing for purity and charge variants, LC-MS peptide mapping for sequence confirmation and post-translational modifications, and released glycan analysis for glycosylation profiles.

> "When two independent methods agree on a critical quality attribute, the specification writes itself."

### Comparability and Forced Degradation
For biosimilars and process changes, we layer forced degradation studies on top — mapping oxidation, deamidation, and fragmentation pathways so comparability assessments rest on mechanism, not just numbers.

Biosimilar development succeeds or fails on the strength of its comparability package. Regulators expect a stepwise demonstration that the candidate matches the reference product in structure, function, and behavior.

### Analytical Similarity First
The foundation is a comprehensive side-by-side analytical assessment: primary structure, higher-order structure, charge and size variants, glycosylation, and biological activity. We design these studies around the reference product's quality attribute ranges, sourced from multi-lot analysis.

### Functional and Stability Evidence
Binding and cell-based potency assays confirm functional equivalence, while comparative forced degradation and real-time stability programs show the molecule behaves identically under stress. A well-built comparability package reduces clinical burden and shortens the path to submission.

Bispecific antibodies offer powerful therapeutic mechanisms, but their multi-chain architecture creates manufacturing challenges that monoclonals never face: heavy-chain homodimers, light-chain mispairing, and complex impurity profiles.

### Engineering Around the Problem
Format selection drives manufacturability. Whether working with knobs-into-holes, CrossMab, or fragment-based formats, we tune expression ratios and construct design during cell line development to maximize correctly paired product from the start.

### Purification and Analytics for Misproducts
Downstream, we deploy charge-based and affinity polishing steps that separate mispaired species from the target heterodimer. Orthogonal analytics — intact mass, CE-SDS, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography — quantify each species so purification development is guided by numbers, not guesswork.

Antibody-drug conjugates merge the targeting of a monoclonal antibody with the potency of a cytotoxic payload — and the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) is the attribute that defines both efficacy and safety.

### Measuring DAR Precisely
We characterize DAR distribution using hydrophobic interaction chromatography for positional isomers and LC-MS for mass-confirmed drug loading. Free payload and related impurities are tracked by orthogonal reversed-phase methods.

### Controlling the Conjugation Process
Conjugation development optimizes payload equivalence, reaction time, temperature, and quench strategy to hit a narrow DAR target window with minimal aggregation. Every batch is released against specifications built from process capability data — not arbitrary limits.

Analytical methods underpin every release decision in biologics manufacturing. Under ICH Q2(R1), each method must prove it measures what it claims to measure — reproducibly, specifically, and robustly.

### Validation by Method Purpose
Validation design follows the method's role. Purity methods emphasize specificity and precision; quantitative assays add accuracy and linearity across the reportable range; limit tests focus on detection and quantitation limits. We write protocols that match the intended use, then execute with full traceability.

### Robustness and Transfer
Robustness studies challenge the method against deliberate parameter variations, and formal method transfer protocols carry validated performance into QC laboratories. The result is a validation package that stands up to FDA and EMA inspection without remediation.
